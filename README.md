# DSA Repository

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! 📚 This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of DSA programs, each designed to help you master core concepts through practice and implementation.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Programs/**: Contains all DSA programs, each in a dedicated subfolder. Each program focuses on a specific DSA concept or problem, complete with explanations and optimized solutions.
    - Example: `1-Reverse The Array/` for reversing an array.

- **Resources/**: There's an index.xlsx file for quick reference & navigation through the clutter of programs.
